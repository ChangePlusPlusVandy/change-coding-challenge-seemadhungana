I am unfamiliar with the use of APIs and HTTP requests in Java. I created a Twitter Developer Account and was able to retrieve tweets from a given user's timeline, but the number of tweets I could retrieve was very limited. If given more time, I would be able to more efficiently retrieve a greater quanity of  Twitter data and be able to filter the tweets by their attributes. Also, with respect to the user's input, I would create a for loop as a method of data validation to ensure the user's input is applicable to the game.
